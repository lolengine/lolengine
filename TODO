 Large projects
----------------

  - Scripting support.
	  - Lua is supported, check if CPP -> LUA ticking/updating is supported
	  - Lua needs more than one-shot-script
	  - Lua classes may still be a little bit obfuscated, a class renaming/revamping may be needed
  - Tiler and Forge are almost the same, try to refactor them.

 Engine classes
----------------

Scene:
  - Remove uses of g_scene
  - Maybe make Camera a world object instead?

Image:
  - Handle pitch in SDL codec (and all others, actually)
  - Fix the Floyd-Steinberg code in pixels.cpp
  - Add gamma handling in pixels.cpp
  - Port remaining libpipi files from src/image/todo/:

Thread:
  - Solidify "Threaded-update" objects support
  - AsyncImageLoader: "File modified update" is supported by OS, it should use that instead of doing it by hand
  - Thread usage may still be a little bit awkward

Debug:
  - Add history support. And layer-like sub-section ? (with imGUI support ?)
  - ::DrawSetup* is fricking awkward, even I (Touky) get confused by it
  
Shaders:
  - Creation/Setup is still a bit complicated, should look into making it more readable (compatibility with lua ?)
  
Frame Buffer Object:
  - They were working at some point , check if it's still the case, but are still very awkward to use
